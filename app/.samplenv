# IMPORTANT: This is a sample template provided as a starting point for your .env file
# 
# In practice, .env files should NEVER be committed to version control
# as they often contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
#
# Copy this file into a file named .env and edit it as needed
# Your new .env file will not be tracked by git by default (see .gitignore)
# Thus, you are the only one who can see any changes made to your .env file
# In your Running instructions in the README file, let us know what environment
# variables are needed to run your code
